#  Open a link directly in a Safari Web App.

With macOS 14 Sonoma, Apple introduced Safari Web Apps (SWA), which turns a website into an application. Personally I think Safari Web App is a much better concept than Progressive Web App. Because each SWA is a separate instance from Safari, its history will no longer be a part of Safari's history. I find the best use case is open a private tab, then select Add to Dock. And we'll have an app-like experience which absolutely has nothing to do with the Safari browser.
However, the downside is we can't, or couldn't actually, directly send a link from an SWA to another SWA. For example, I have Facebook, Instagram and Threads as SWA, and I couldn’t directly send a link from Facebook to Instagram and vice versa. When I made a click on a link, it must be opened in Safari, then I needed to click the “Open in app” button in the top banner so invoke the SWA handler. This app is made to solve that very problem. 
Simply make a right click on an appropriate link, then select Share → Open In SWA and the correct SWA will be called, or simply drag the link into the Dock icon, which comes in handy in case you're using a different browser than Safari that doesn't support Share action.
If an app offers "Open with" (a web browser) feature such as 'https://mimestream.com', you can select Open In SWA in the list.
