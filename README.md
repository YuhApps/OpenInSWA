#  Open a link in a Safari Web App.

With macOS 14 Sonoma, Apple introduced Safari Web Apps (SWA), which turns a website into an application. Personally I think Safari Web App is a much better concept than Progressive Web App. Because each SWA is a separate instance from Safari, its history will no longer be a part of Safari's history. I find the best use case is open a private tab in Safari, then select Add to Dock. And we'll have an app-like experience.
However, the downside is we can't, or couldn't actually, directly open a link with a SWA. For example, I had a Facebook SWA, and when I wanted to open a direct link, say 'https://wwww.facebook.com/MKBHD' with the Facebook SWA, I couldn't. I had to use Safari then "Open with Facebook" button, which took too much time for such as simple task. But now there is **Open in SWA**. Simply paste the link into the text box and press Return/Enter on your keyboard and the app will take care of the rest. No more Safari involved.
You can also make a right click on an appropriate link, then select Share â†’ Open In SWA and the correct SWA will be invoked, or simply drag the link into the Dock icon, which is handy in case you're using a different browser than Safari that doesn't support Share action.
If an app offers "Open with" (a web browser) feature such as ![Mimestream](https://mimestream.com/), you can select Open In SWA in the list.
